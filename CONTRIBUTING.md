## 🧪 Code Quality & Testing

To maintain consistency and prevent bugs across the codebase, **we enforce strict code quality checks**.

### ESLint Configuration
* **Do not ignore or delete the ESLint configuration**: The `eslint.config.js` file is version-controlled and pushed to the remote repository. This ensures that every developer and the CI/CD environment runs the exact same checks.
* **Running the Linter**: Before committing your changes, make sure to run:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
  All errors must be resolved, and warnings should be kept to a minimum.

### TypeScript Type-Checking
* All code in the `src/` directory should be type-safe. Run the type-checker before opening a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck
  ```
  Your code must compile without type errors.

## 🚀 Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a Branch**: Always create a feature or bugfix branch off of the main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Commit Changes**: Make clear, atomic commits with descriptive commit messages.
3. **Run Local Verifications**:
   - Ensure the app starts and runs without runtime crashes.
   - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` to verify code quality.
4. **Submit a PR**: Open a Pull Request on GitHub against the main branch. Explain your changes and link any related issues.
