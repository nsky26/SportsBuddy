# SportsBuddy

SportsBuddy is a React Native mobile application built using the Expo framework and TypeScript.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app installed on your physical device (iOS or Android), or an emulator set up on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nsky26/SportsBuddy.git
   cd SportsBuddy
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

Start the Expo development server by running:
```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can press:
- `a` to open the app on an Android emulator.
- `i` to open the app on an iOS simulator (macOS only).
- `w` to open the app in a web browser.
- Or, scan the QR code in the terminal using your phone's camera (iOS) or the Expo Go app (Android).

Alternatively, you can run the platform-specific scripts:
- **Android**: `npm run android`
- **iOS**: `npm run ios`
- **Web**: `npm run web`

## 🧪 Linting and Type Checking

To ensure code quality and type safety, the project uses ESLint and TypeScript compilation checks:
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to scan the codebase for style and quality issues.
- **Type Checking**: Run `npm run typecheck` to run the TypeScript compiler in no-emit mode.
